## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) Bootstrap 5



### What I learned

I got exposed to new bootstrap classes like the `accordion` in the FAQ section,tab system and the bootstrap navigation system. I also got a little better understanding on alignment and containers


### **Continued development**

This wont be my last....No it wont
ill make more designs and share on my github, but hopefully this would be enough to impress


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) - You can get easy snippets and understand bootstrap better from its website
- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - Stack Overflow was my go to whenever i had any problems. You should try going there often.
